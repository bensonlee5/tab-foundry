## Anchor Comparison

Upstream reference: `PerceiverIO` from `https://openreview.net/forum?id=fILj7WpI-g`.

| Dimension | Upstream PerceiverIO | Locked anchor | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| feature encoder | Scalar feature linear encoder with internal train/test z-score+clip handling. | Staged feature encoder `unknown` from the benchmark registry surface. | Feature encoder changes alter the per-cell representation and should be interpreted explicitly. |
| target conditioning | Mean-padded linear target encoder on the direct binary path. | Target conditioner `unknown` from the staged surface. | Target-conditioning changes should be interpreted separately from encoder or context changes. |
| cell transformer block | Post-norm nanoTabPFN block with feature attention then row attention. | Cell transformer block `unknown` from the staged surface. | Cell-block changes affect the core table computation and should be isolated carefully. |
| tokenizer | One scalar token per feature. | Tokenizer `unknown` from the staged surface. | Tokenizer changes alter the token sequence presented to the transformer stack. |
| column encoder | None on the upstream direct path. | Column encoder `unknown` from the staged surface. | Column-encoder changes should be read separately from row pooling or context changes. |
| row readout | Target-column readout from the final cell tensor. | Row pool `unknown` from the staged surface. | Row-pool changes alter the readout contract and require their own interpretation. |
| context encoder | None on the upstream direct path. | Context encoder `unknown` from the staged surface. | Context-encoder changes alter how training rows condition test rows. |
| prediction head | Direct binary logits head. | Prediction head `unknown` from the staged surface. | Head changes alter the task contract and output semantics. |
| training data surface | OpenML notebook tasks only for benchmarking; no repo-local prior-training manifest contract. | Benchmark manifest local id `openml_classification_medium_v1` sourced from `nanotabpfn_openml_classification_medium` (242 tasks (missing values permitted)) with data surface label `tf_rd_010_dagzoo_medium_control`. | Manifest and training-data changes are first-class sweep rows and should not be inherited from parent sweep prose. |
| preprocessing | Notebook preprocessing inside the benchmark helper. | Benchmark preprocessing surface label `runtime_default`. | Preprocessing changes can alter the effective task definition and must be tracked explicitly. |
| training recipe | No repo-local prior-dump training-surface contract. | Training surface label `prior_cosine_warmup`. | Optimizer and schedule changes are first-class sweep rows, not background recipe assumptions. |

## Detailed Rows

### 1. `delta_tf_rd_009_cls_sandwich_dicl96_v1`

- Dimension family: `model`
- Status: `ready`
- Binary applicable: `False`
- Recipe alias: `none`
- Description: Increase TF-RD-009 classification sandwich width from `d_icl=60` to `96` while keeping the carried `sandwich_heads=1` architecture and the TF-RD-022 runtime bundle fixed.
- Rationale: Execute 96x2 at max_steps=625 and grad_accum_steps=1 for the TF-RD-009 Phase 2 scaling-law study.
- Hypothesis: 
- Upstream delta: TF-RD-009 treats width as the clean first transfer axis after the heads1 replay anchor is benchmark-registry-backed.
- Anchor delta: Phase-two scaling row 96x2 reuses the locked 96x2 anchor surface and changes only the declared geometry or step budget for the study family.
- Expected effect: If the carried heads1 classification surface is still width-limited on the closed medium contract, increasing to `d_icl=96` should improve benchmark fit without reopening any other sandwich knob.
- Effective labels: model=`tabfoundry_sandwich`, data=`tf_rd_010_dagzoo_medium_control`, preprocessing=`runtime_default`, training=`prior_cosine_warmup`

- Dimension family: `model`
- Status: `ready`
- Binary applicable: `False`
- Recipe alias: `none`
- Description: Increase TF-RD-009 classification sandwich width from `d_icl=60` to `96` while keeping the carried `sandwich_heads=1` architecture and the TF-RD-022 runtime bundle fixed.
- Rationale: Execute 96x2 at max_steps=625 and grad_accum_steps=2 for the TF-RD-009 Phase 2 scaling-law study.
- Hypothesis: 
- Upstream delta: TF-RD-009 treats width as the clean first transfer axis after the heads1 replay anchor is benchmark-registry-backed.
- Anchor delta: Phase-two scaling row 96x2 reuses the locked 96x2 anchor surface and changes only the declared geometry or step budget for the study family.
- Expected effect: If the carried heads1 classification surface is still width-limited on the closed medium contract, increasing to `d_icl=96` should improve benchmark fit without reopening any other sandwich knob.

### 20. `delta_tf_rd_009_cls_sandwich_dicl96_v1`

- Dimension family: `model`
- Status: `ready`
- Binary applicable: `False`
- Recipe alias: `none`
- Description: Increase TF-RD-009 classification sandwich width from `d_icl=60` to `96` while keeping the carried `sandwich_heads=1` architecture and the TF-RD-022 runtime bundle fixed.
- Rationale: Execute 96x2 at max_steps=5000 and grad_accum_steps=16 for the TF-RD-009 Phase 2 scaling-law study.
- Hypothesis: 
- Upstream delta: TF-RD-009 treats width as the clean first transfer axis after the heads1 replay anchor is benchmark-registry-backed.
- Anchor delta: Phase-two scaling row 96x2 reuses the locked 96x2 anchor surface and changes only the declared geometry or step budget for the study family.
- Expected effect: If the carried heads1 classification surface is still width-limited on the closed medium contract, increasing to `d_icl=96` should improve benchmark fit without reopening any other sandwich knob.

- Parameter adequacy plan:
  - Hold geometry at 96x2 while varying only effective batch through grad_accum_steps.
  - Use grad_accum_steps=16 and max_steps=5000 for the Bcrit(L) ladder.
  - Final reported fits must use validation loss from completed runs plus inspected training-only compute accounting.
