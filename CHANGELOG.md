## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Added repo-managed `pre-commit` hooks for `ruff`, `mypy`, and `mdformat`,
  plus local and CI documentation for the shared quality workflow.
- Added an Iris-backed smoke harness that generates manifest-compatible packed
  tasks, trains a real checkpoint through the existing pipeline, evaluates that
  checkpoint, and writes `telemetry.json` plus `summary.md` artifacts.
- Added a GitHub Actions `test` workflow with `quality-and-unit` and
  `iris-smoke` jobs, plus a helper script to configure `main` branch protection
  around those checks.

### Changed

- Refactored shared benchmark/smoke artifact helpers so history loading,
  checkpoint-snapshot timing, JSON persistence, and loss-curve rendering live in
  one bench module instead of duplicated harness code.
