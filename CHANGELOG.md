# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- Added an internal architecture reference at
  `docs/development/tabfoundry-transformer-architecture.md` that documents the
  current tabfoundry transformer stack and its task heads.

### Changed

- Renamed the primary model family from `tabiclv2` to `tabfoundry`. Python
  imports now use `tab_foundry.model.architectures.tabfoundry` with
  `TabFoundryClassifier` and `TabFoundryRegressor`; the old module path and
  class names were removed.
- Export bundles now use `manifest.model.arch="tabfoundry"` and
  `inference_config.model_arch="tabfoundry"` under the new
  `tab-foundry-export-v2` schema. Existing `tab-foundry-export-v1` bundles are
  intentionally unsupported and must be regenerated.
- Updated internal planning, navigation, and contract docs to describe the
  current family as `tabfoundry` and treat `TabICLv2` as an external reference
  rather than the repo's persistent model identity.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- Added a pinned benchmark bundle contract for the `nanoTabPFN` comparison
  flow. Comparison runs now materialize `benchmark_inputs.json` plus
  `benchmark_dataset_cache.npz` in the benchmark output directory, and
  `--benchmark-bundle-dir` opts into reusing a pinned bundle across repeated
  confirmatory runs.

### Changed

- Benchmark comparisons now fail fast on benchmark task-id drift, task-count or
  task-order drift, dataset-cache checksum mismatches, and cache-vs-metadata
  name mismatches before checkpoint evaluation starts.
- `comparison_summary.json` now includes a `benchmark_inputs` block and the
  artifact set now records the pinned `benchmark_inputs.json` path alongside
  the benchmark dataset cache path.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-13

### Changed

- Centralized canonical model-build spec resolution in
  `tab_foundry.model.spec` so training, evaluation, checkpoint loading, and
  export manifest validation share one defaulting and coercion path.
- Consolidated duplicated smoke-harness manifest/config helpers into
  `tab_foundry.bench.smoke_common` while preserving the existing dagzoo and
  Iris workflow behavior.
- Removed package-root convenience re-exports from `tab_foundry.model`,
  `tab_foundry.data`, and `tab_foundry.export`. Direct Python imports should
  now target concrete submodules. This is a Python API cleanup only; CLI flags
  and export bundle or dataset artifact contracts did not change.
- Updated contributor and development docs to reflect the current role-based
  package layout and the repo's actual local verification commands.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Added repo-managed `pre-commit` hooks for `ruff`, `mypy`, and `mdformat`,
  plus local and CI documentation for the shared quality workflow.
- Added an Iris-backed smoke harness that generates manifest-compatible packed
  tasks, trains a real checkpoint through the existing pipeline, evaluates that
  checkpoint, and writes `telemetry.json` plus `summary.md` artifacts.
- Added a GitHub Actions `test` workflow with `quality-and-unit` and
  `iris-smoke` jobs, plus a helper script to configure `main` branch protection
  around those checks.

### Changed

- Refactored shared benchmark/smoke artifact helpers so history loading,
  checkpoint-snapshot timing, JSON persistence, and loss-curve rendering live in
  one bench module instead of duplicated harness code.
